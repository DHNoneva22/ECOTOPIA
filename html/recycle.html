        <p class="paper-text">Recycling paper is an important practice that helps conserve 
                     natural resources, reduce waste, and<br>
                      minimize environmental impact.
                      When paper is recycled, it can be turned into new paper products,
                       reducing the need to cut down more trees.</p>

        <p class="plastic-text">Recycling plastic is a process that involves collecting, <br>sorting, cleaning,
                       and processing plastic waste to produce new products. This helps to reduce the<br>
                        amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills and <br>the environment, thus
                         contributing to environmental sustainability.</p>
